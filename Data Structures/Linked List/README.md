# Linked List

A linked list is a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links. Each data element contains a connection to another data element in form of a pointer.
           
***Python does not have linked lists in its standard library.***
            

# Types of Linked list:
- Single linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Circular linked list
       

## Single linked list
